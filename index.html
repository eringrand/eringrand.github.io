      <h1><a href="/clean-data/">Best Practices for Cleaning Data in R</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>A few months ago, I gave a talk at the previously known as NYC R
conference, now known as <a href="https://rstats.ai/nyc">New York Data Science and
AI</a>. (<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Cx-UxNCONaE&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fdataconf.ai%2F&amp;source_ve_path=Mjg2NjY">Watch it
here!</a>)
My presentation focused on my favorite topic: handling duplicates in
data, and the importance of data cleaning.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>I’ve been a data scientist in the non-profit sector for 5+ years. In an earlier conversation with people starting their transition into data science, we talked about how non-profit data can be an excellent place to start. There are some cons to beginning at a non-profit - but I love it.</p>

      <h1><a href="/fave_r_functions/">Twitter's Favorite Lesser Known Packages</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>At the 2018 December NYC R Ladies meetup (yes this post has been sitting in my drafts for over a year), a group started talking about how a few tiny functions in a lesser-known package can provide you with serious magic. The problem is finding those packages and functions! With so many amazing packages on CRAN and GitHub, how do you even begin to search?  One way - ask all your twitter followers what they think, and twitter did not disappoint - so here are some examples of <em>amazing</em> packages and functions you might want to learn about.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Inspired by <a href="http://juliasilge.com/">Julia’s Silge’s</a> recent talk on
<a href="http://tidytextmining.com/">Tidytext</a> as part of <a href="https://open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/">NASA
Datanauts</a>, and her blog
posts, I decided to try my hand at some text analysis. Julia’s examples
focus on the works of Jane Austen. As Jane Austen has been adapted so
many time, I decided to “adapt” Julia’s talk for the modern works of
Austen’s book Pride and Prejudice - specifically the Lizzie Bennet Diaries.</p>

      <h1><a href="/ctlinternship/">My Internship With Crisis Text Line</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>At the end of spring semester, I sent in my application to <a href="https://www.dosomething.org/">DoSomething.org</a> for their Data Intern position. I found out about the position through a communication that started over Github, and thought it sounded interesting. I sent in my resume and cover letter and waited to see what would happen. I made it through to the next rounds. The last step was a phone interview where I gave a quick presentation on my analysis on some data, and talked about what the internship was about and what I was interested in. I mentioned that what brought me to Data Science was teaching, and how I hoped to be involved with research and education technology in the future. I didn’t get the job.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>At some point this past week, I came to the realization that of the professors I’ve had this year, I’ve only referred to the female professor by her first name in conversation with other students. I wondered if this was indicative of some larger issue, or if it’s just because she’s also our class adviser.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Graphics and visualizations are used for promotion, advertisement to promote a product or idea. In science, graphics tend to fall into one of two categories: for use in education or a science journal.  For information on what makes a good educational graphic, or a teaching tool, I’ve written a piece earlier on this blog <a href="http://eringrand.github.io/educationgraphics/">here</a>. 
In the academic articles, graphics hold a special role in telling a compelling story of the data and results, however, the editing emphasis is often placed much more on text than making interesting and understandable science graphics.</p>
