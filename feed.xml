        <title>Reviewing my old live journal posts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m about to BARE MY SOUL to the internet. Well, the soul of my teenage
self. Get ready!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live Journal, you may remember, was(/is - it does still exist) was a blogging site before we really knew what blogging was. It was both a place to put diary entries and those quizzes that got passed around in the day. It was also used for FanFic and community gathering. I did NOT use my (main) account for fan gathering. (Though I did write some excellent/terrible fanfics. Didn’t everyone have a Lord of Rings self-insert character?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really remember when I started this idea, but I thought it would be fun to see just how emo I was in 2006. Let’s go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-0-load-the-libraries&quot;&gt;Step 0: Load the libraries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(tidytext)
library(hunspell)
library(ggrepel)
library(cowplot)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-clean-the-data&quot;&gt;Step 1: Clean the data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I downloaded all my past Live Journal entities to a folder on my desktop
in the same CSV format, so that I could easily load them in for
analysis. I am pleasantly surprised that Live Journal made it so easy to
download my history like this! I did have to click the same button a ton
of time - but I did get all my data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was to take every journal and separate out the individual
words using
‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/vignettes/tidytext.html&quot;&gt;tidytext&lt;/a&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;lj_words &amp;lt;- lj_df %&amp;gt;%
  select(itemid, eventtime, logtime, subject, current_music, current_mood, event) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(across(c(eventtime, logtime), ymd_hms),
         year = year(logtime),
         month = month(logtime),
         ) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(event = str_remove_all(event, &quot;&apos;&quot;)) %&amp;gt;%
  unnest_tokens(word, event, token = &quot;words&quot;, format = &quot;html&quot;, strip_url = FALSE) 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not included in this blog post, for privacy of my teenage friends, I
also cleaned and changed names of my friends and locations to clean the
data and protect their privacy. For example, instead of the name “Linda”
you may see “nameofsister”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was (and continue to be) terrible at spelling words correctly and also
terrible at checking what I’ve typed after the fact. I use ‘Hunspell’
here in an attempt to fix some of the most common issues. Does this
spell check get everything? No! But alas, I am a terrible speller and we
move on in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;lj_words_spell_check &amp;lt;- lj_words_protect %&amp;gt;%
  anti_join(my_stop_words, by = &quot;word&quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  count(word) %&amp;gt;%
  rowwise() %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(spell_check = hunspell(word)) %&amp;gt;%
  filter(length(spell_check) &amp;gt;= 1) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(suggest = hunspell_suggest(spell_check)) 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;lj_correct &amp;lt;- lj_words_spell_check %&amp;gt;%
  filter(length(suggest) &amp;gt; 0) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(suggest_pick = pluck(suggest, 1)) %&amp;gt;% # just pick the first one because I am lazy
  ungroup() %&amp;gt;%
  unnest(suggest_pick) %&amp;gt;%
  select(word, suggest_pick) 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;lj_words_corrected &amp;lt;- lj_words_protect %&amp;gt;%
  left_join(lj_correct, by = &quot;word&quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(word = coalesce(suggest_pick, word)) %&amp;gt;%
  unnest_tokens(output = &quot;word&quot;, input = word) # used because sometimes the correction is actually 2+ words now 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-now-we-move-on-to-analysis&quot;&gt;Step 2: Now we move on to analysis!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data is clean, or at least as clean as it is going to get today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;word-counts&quot;&gt;Word counts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start with TF-IDF. The goal here is to see what I was talking about
each year and how it may differ as I got older. As a reminder, I have
changed the names of all my friends and family for privacy. That way you
don’t know who “nameofbestfriend” is and why I stopped mentioning
“nameofbestfriend” in 2006. (We had a bit of a falling out at the end of
HS.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;tfidf &amp;lt;- lj_words_corrected %&amp;gt;%
  count(year, word) %&amp;gt;% 
  tidytext::bind_tf_idf(word, year, n) %&amp;gt;%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = &quot;word&quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  group_by(year) %&amp;gt;%
  top_n(n = 10, wt = tf_idf) %&amp;gt;%
  ungroup() %&amp;gt;%
  filter(n &amp;gt;= 2) 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022-06-28-LJ_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at 2009 - clearly my only entries were my Norse myth college class. I remember I put a few of my class papers on my Live Journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can look at the differences between TF-IDF and a regular word count,
while accounting for stop words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;wordcount &amp;lt;- lj_words_corrected %&amp;gt;%
  count(year, word) %&amp;gt;%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = &quot;word&quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  group_by(year) %&amp;gt;%
  top_n(n = 10, wt = n) %&amp;gt;%
  ungroup() %&amp;gt;%
  filter(n &amp;gt;= 3) 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022-06-28-LJ_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sentiment&quot;&gt;Sentiment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I look at sentiment. I remember using live journal to be super
&lt;em&gt;angsty&lt;/em&gt;. I assumed that I would largely see negative sentiment and
words across the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;df_plot &amp;lt;- lj_words_corrected %&amp;gt;%
  left_join (get_sentiments(&quot;bing&quot;), by = &quot;word&quot; ) %&amp;gt;%
  rename(bing_sentiment = sentiment) %&amp;gt;%
  left_join (get_sentiments(&quot;nrc&quot;), by = &quot;word&quot; ) %&amp;gt;%
  rename(nrc_sentiment = sentiment) %&amp;gt;%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(bing_sentiment, nrc_sentiment), 
               names_to = &quot;sentiment_type&quot;, values_to = &quot;sentiment&quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  count(sentiment_type, year, sentiment) %&amp;gt;%
  filter(! is.na(sentiment) ) %&amp;gt;%
  rename(count = n ) %&amp;gt;%
  group_by(sentiment_type, year) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(total = sum(count)) %&amp;gt;%
  ungroup() %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(percent = count / total,
         year_month = ymd(str_c(year, &quot;01&quot;, &quot;01&quot;, sep = &quot;-&quot;))
         ) 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, it seems my words were largely more positive then negative.
(Outside of 2009 - which is either largely from my anxiety attacks that year or Norse mythology is just super depressing.) Not as ansgty as I remember!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022-06-28-LJ_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, but did I mark my “current mood” / how are you feeling” part as
positive as my words are? You be the judge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022-06-28-LJ_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;end-&quot;&gt;End :)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. Was teenage Erin as emo as I thought? Maybe not! Or maybe I wrote all the most emo journals in my physical diary. The world will never know (because those diaries have been lost).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Data science jobs in the non-profit sector</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a data scientist in the non-profit sector for 5+ years. In an earlier conversation with people starting their transition into data science, we talked about how non-profit data can be an excellent place to start. There are some cons to beginning at a non-profit - but I love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, non-profits data roles have similarities with start-up positions. A non-profit data role may involve doing more work than described in the job description (e.g., analysis and project management at the same time). Due to a lack of funding, non-profits cannot hire individual people for all the needed work, so a new hire can end up filling many job roles at once. This early experience in more extensive work is a magnificent step for learning on the job. “Personally, I think non-profit DS is the perfect place to start a career :) so much messy data, and so many wins, even from “basic” models.” (Caitlin Hudon) In larger for profit-tech companies, In for-profit tech companies, people are not wearing some many hats. In non-profits, you end up being more cross trained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a possible con to joining a smaller non-profit OR start-up is that you may be one of the first data people in the company. Data Science teams often don’t exist at non-profits, and as the first or early data person, you are forced to grow your skills quickly on the job, but it also means you won’t have an on-site mentor on the job. “In my current position, my manager is self-taught in coding… He does most things in SQL.” - Kevin Gilds. In chapter 9 of their book, Building a Career in Data Science, Emily Robison &amp;amp; Jaqueline Nolis talk more about being the first or only data person on the job. When there is a data team in place, non-profits often have smaller data teams. The day-to-day work is likely to be more aligned with reporting/analysis than machine learning. If you are looking specifically to get involved in modeling ASAP, a non-profit will not be the best place to start. That said, the messy data difficulties in a non-profit can often lead to quick wins for automation and coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In companies without a dedicated data team, data structures and cleaning become crucial as data is likely in spreadsheets. SQL and Excel skills are more appreciated than complicated programming skills.  I have loved working with messy data as it has allowed me to shape the policies and work to create more organized structures. “You will never find better datasets to cut your teeth on than working with non-profit data.” (Caitlin Hudon)  Given the often early data stages, you can do quick magic with a spreadsheet. Apply some automation in an excel macro or a pivot table gives you an early win with the data and stakeholders. Teaching others how to do a vlookup could make a difference between them spending 5min vs. 1-2 hours on a task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clear win or difference, for me, at a non-profit is that everyone is passionately mission-driven. Non-profit employees are not there just for the money (though, hey - let’s pay people what they’re worth, please). Tech and data skills can be uniquely used in a mission-driven space to do fantastic work to make the world better. For example, in an education company, working with student data can directly influence how a teacher can help them perform even better on SATs, enabling them access to a better college. At a mental health company, data work provides information for counselors to better help their clients - literally saving lives.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Twitter&apos;s Favorite Lesser Known Packages</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the 2018 December NYC R Ladies meetup (yes this post has been sitting in my drafts for over a year), a group started talking about how a few tiny functions in a lesser-known package can provide you with serious magic. The problem is finding those packages and functions! With so many amazing packages on CRAN and GitHub, how do you even begin to search?  One way - ask all your twitter followers what they think, and twitter did not disappoint - so here are some examples of &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; packages and functions you might want to learn about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The types of functions offered seemed to fall in a couple buckets. For example, making tasks you do all the time easier (cleaning data, summary), dealing with data structures that aren’t are easy to deal with (factors, strings.. etc), visualizations, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-tasks&quot;&gt;Data Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite lesser known package is &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfirke.github.io/janitor/&quot;&gt;Janitor&lt;/a&gt; by Sam Firke. This package has basic functions to clean and prep messy data files. The functions are mostly relatively easy to replicate with dplyr, but why write the same thing over and over when Janitor does it for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Mine are, from janitor...&lt;br /&gt;1. clean_names&lt;br /&gt;2. get_dupes&lt;br /&gt;3. remove_empty&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Erin Grand (@astroeringrand) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/astroeringrand/status/1072325599300071431?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 11, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.ropensci.org/skimr/&quot;&gt;Skimr&lt;/a&gt;, as suggested by Fernando Flores, started at an ROpenSci Un-conf that provides a better summary function. It creates both a tidy version of the summary table to work with and a visual version to inspect. This is super useful for investigating data issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Couldn&amp;#39;t choose just one package, so here we go:&lt;br /&gt;skimr::skim&lt;br /&gt;covr::report&lt;br /&gt;DT::JS&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Fernando Flores (@ds_floresf) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ds_floresf/status/1072539510448275456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 11, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-types&quot;&gt;Data Types&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tidyverse packages for dealing with specific data types are not nearly as widely used as they can be; forcats, lubridate, glue, and stringr can help solve so many problems with factor, dates, and strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;From forcats:&lt;br /&gt;1. fct_infreq&lt;br /&gt;2. fct_rev&lt;br /&gt;3. fct_drop&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Emily Zabor (@zabormetrics) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zabormetrics/status/1073648773014929413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 14, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;forcats::fct_lump&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/2BboLbdzuS&quot;&gt;https://t.co/2BboLbdzuS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;glue::glue and glue::glue_data&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Bxt20MQGi2&quot;&gt;https://t.co/Bxt20MQGi2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheated and use 2x packages.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Thomas Mock 👨🏼
💻 (@thomas_mock) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thomas_mock/status/1072328281741901824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 11, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;you stole mine! 😉 this is kind of cheating but from lubridate: year(), month(), day()&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Luuuda (@ludmila_janda) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ludmila_janda/status/1072339517821067264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 11, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;plotting-support&quot;&gt;Plotting Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few of the recommendations focused on vizulations and plotting. Key shouts outs for naniar and patchwork. &lt;a href=&quot;http://naniar.njtierney.com/&quot;&gt;Naniar&lt;/a&gt; helps you visualize your missing values. &lt;a href=&quot;https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/&quot;&gt;Patchwork&lt;/a&gt; allows you to combine plots together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;From two packages, super handy at first steps after loading dataset: &lt;br /&gt;naniar::gg_miss_var&lt;br /&gt;summarytools::descr&lt;br /&gt;summarytools::freq&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Radoslaw Panczak (@RPanczak) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RPanczak/status/1072674486326124544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 12, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other&quot;&gt;Other&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are were a ton of other amazing offerings for excellent packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magrittr package has many useful operators outside of the normal %&amp;gt;% pipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I was going to say  %&amp;lt;&amp;gt;% , %&amp;lt;&amp;gt;% , and   %&amp;lt;&amp;gt;%  from magrittr - I use it all the time now thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/robinson_es?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@robinson_es&lt;/a&gt; - but now I&amp;#39;m browsing other magrittr functions and the aliases like extract() etc would be v handy when piping&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Sarah R (@srhrnkn) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/srhrnkn/status/1072870594314625024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 12, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you work with spatial data at all, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/&quot;&gt;sf&lt;/a&gt; package is a must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The sf package cleared my skin, cleaned my home &amp;amp; cured my anxiety&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Brooke Watson (@brookLYNevery1) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brookLYNevery1/status/1072616772870770695?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 11, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I added the `conflicted` package to my RProfile this summer, and I really love that it warns me about possible name conflicts _before_ I run into problems &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/46Y88gexP9&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/46Y88gexP9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Irene Steves (@i_steves) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/i_steves/status/1088884286101573632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 25, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your favorite lesser know package or function? Sound off in the comments (or find me on twitter).&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;orginal-plan---scrape-from-archive&quot;&gt;Orginal Plan - Scrape from Archive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long while ago now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Nujcharee&quot;&gt;Nujchare&lt;/a&gt; tweeted about an awesome vis she did using &lt;code&gt;rvest&lt;/code&gt; and PowerBi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Using rvest + purrr packages to scrap APOD. PowerBI viz it up real nice! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/powerbi?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#powerbi&lt;/a&gt;. My learning journal during &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/NASADatanauts?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#NASADatanauts&lt;/a&gt; year of awesomeness.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/cnwttLPoIS&quot;&gt;https://t.co/cnwttLPoIS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/je511h99L9&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/je511h99L9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nujcharee (เป็ด) (@Nujcharee) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Nujcharee/status/939257591431036929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 8, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I complemented her work and she asked me to look over the code. I jumped at the chance, (1) because I don’t know a ton about scraping website data and wanted to see what she started, (2) I could help with the &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; part of the code, and most imporantly (3) I love APOD!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love APOD so much, that for most of my childhood my life goal was “get a picture published to APOD.” To make matters more exciting in 2009 &lt;a href=&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090917.html&quot;&gt;this happened&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/apod_me.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-the-data&quot;&gt;Getting the Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, we grab the information from the landing page of APOD’s archive and ignore any links that are not pictures of the day. (Luckily, these all start with “ap” so we can use &lt;code&gt;str_detect()&lt;/code&gt; to find them.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)

## scrape the landing page
apod &amp;lt;- read_html(&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/archivepix.html&quot;)

## scrape all URLs
url &amp;lt;- html_nodes(apod, &quot;a&quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
  map_chr(xml_attrs) %&amp;gt;%
  tibble(url = .) %&amp;gt;%
  filter(str_detect(url, &quot;ap&quot;), !str_detect(url, &quot;/&quot;))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we have to go to each of the pages and scrape the underlying page data. There are A LOT of APODs, so this can take a long time. I’ve chosen to only look at the first 1000 images for now. (More on solving this at the end!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;# read html from url
my_read_html &amp;lt;- function(url, ...) {
  xml2::read_html(url, ...)
}

data_raw &amp;lt;- url[1:1000, ] %&amp;gt;% # first 1000 links
  mutate(full_url = paste0(&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/&quot;, url)) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(page = map(full_url, my_read_html),
         pic = map_chr(page, ~html_node(.x, xpath = &quot;//*/img&quot;) %&amp;gt;% html_attr(&quot;src&quot;)),
         title = map_chr(page, ~html_nodes(.x, &quot;title&quot;) %&amp;gt;% html_text()),
         description = map_chr(page, ~html_nodes(.x, &quot;p&quot;) %&amp;gt;% html_text() %&amp;gt;% .[str_detect(., &quot;Ex&quot;)]) # descriptions start with &quot;Explanation:&quot;
         )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-cleaning&quot;&gt;Data Cleaning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the raw data in hand, I move into more specific text cleaning. I want to start with some quick tidy text analysis of the descriptions, so I cant to clean that up first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;data &amp;lt;- data_raw %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(description = str_replace_all(description, &quot;\n&quot;, &quot; &quot;),
         description = str_replace_all(description, &quot;Explanation:&quot;, &quot;&quot;),
         title = str_replace_all(title, &quot;\n&quot;, &quot; &quot;),
         title = str_replace_all(title, &quot;APOD:&quot;, &quot;&quot;),
         title = if_else(str_detect(title, &quot;2017 November 22&quot;), &quot;2017 November 22 - Oumuamua Interstellar Asteroid&quot;, title)
         ) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate_all(trimws) %&amp;gt;%
  separate(title, into = c(&quot;date&quot;, &quot;title&quot;), sep = &quot; - &quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great, now we can a do a quick word count using tidytext tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fun-stuff---word-count&quot;&gt;Fun Stuff - word count&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;keep_words &amp;lt;- c(&quot;way&quot;) # I don&apos;t want &quot;way&quot; as in &quot;Milky Way&quot; to be filtered
my_stop_words &amp;lt;- tibble(word = c(&quot;image&quot;)) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(lexicon = &quot;PERSONAL&quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  bind_rows(stop_words) %&amp;gt;%
  filter(!word %in% keep_words)
  

data %&amp;gt;%
  select(-date) %&amp;gt;%
  distinct() %&amp;gt;%
  unnest_tokens(word, description) %&amp;gt;%
  anti_join(my_stop_words) %&amp;gt;%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %&amp;gt;%
  top_n(10)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 10 x 2
##    word       n
##    &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;
##  1 light   1088
##  2 star     725
##  3 stars    656
##  4 galaxy   636
##  5 nebula   627
##  6 moon     522
##  7 sun      497
##  8 earth    496
##  9 bright   461
## 10 sky      411
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this because it clearly shows the types of objects that make up most of pretty Astronomy pictures, i.e stars, galaxies and nebulae. Very cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I look at bi-grams is there any doubt that “Milky Way” will have a strong showing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;data %&amp;gt;%
  select(-date) %&amp;gt;%
  distinct() %&amp;gt;%
  unnest_tokens(word, description, token = &quot;ngrams&quot;, n = 2) %&amp;gt;%
  select(title, word) %&amp;gt;%
  separate(word, into = c(&quot;word1&quot;, &quot;word2&quot;), by = &quot; &quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  unite(word, word1, word2, sep = &quot; &quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %&amp;gt;%
  top_n(10)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 10 x 2
##    word                n
##    &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;           &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;
##  1 milky way         315
##  2 planet earth      205
##  3 way galaxy        133
##  4 million light     118
##  5 solar system      114
##  6 space telescope   106
##  7 star forming      100
##  8 hubble space       88
##  9 spiral galaxy      88
## 10 star cluster       75
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and there it is, clearly winning over “Planet Earth” and “Solar System.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a person who studied star formation, I’m also proud of the strong showing of “star forming” in the bi-grams. Yay baby stars!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-wait-isnt-there-an-api&quot;&gt;But wait… isn’t there an API?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is great and fun, but what I’d really love to look at the entire APOD archive, or pull a specific date. Luckily, NASA has a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nasa/apod-api&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; to do just that! The API is super easy to use and simple enough to write into some R functions. I decided the coolest thing to do with this API was create a package, and thus my new package - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eringrand/astropic&quot;&gt;astropic&lt;/a&gt; was born (available on github)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eringrand/astropic&quot;&gt;astropic&lt;/a&gt; is to connect R to the NASA APOD API. The APOD API supports one image at a time. In order to supply more than that, this package also includes creating time ranges (of less than 1000 days at a time) and some historical data in tibble format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can install the current version from GitHub to check it out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;# install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;)
devtools::install_github(&quot;eringrand/astropic&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eringrand/astropic&quot;&gt;Astropic&lt;/a&gt; does not yet contain ANY tests and the documentation is very sparse. It is most definitely a work in progress - I’ll update more as I add more to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time on the blog, more about the package creation and cool things you can do with it. In the mean time, please feel free to send pull requests and let me know what you’d like from such a package.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Faces of rstudioconf</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was reminded today by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/d4tagirl&quot;&gt;Daniela&lt;/a&gt; that everyone should blog - and on top of that you can totally blog something small and simple just to get something out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of small and simple, last week I tweeted out this cool image…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I am writing up my notes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstduiconf?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#rstduiconf&lt;/a&gt; (blog post coming!) and wanted to have a quick picture to go with my thoughts. Remembering &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ma_salmon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ma_salmon&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#39;s post on Faces of R (here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/C1sRW3hwVL&quot;&gt;https://t.co/C1sRW3hwVL&lt;/a&gt; ), I decided to make a Faces of Rstudioconf! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/vtNVn2RyHV&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/vtNVn2RyHV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Erin Grand (@astroeringrand) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/astroeringrand/status/961466502821052416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 8, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>R in the World of Education</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently gave a &lt;a href=&quot;/Presentations/rladies-nyc/data-education.html&quot;&gt;r-ladies presentation&lt;/a&gt; about my work cleaning and working with really messy education data. This blog post is an attempt at summarizing the main points of the &lt;a href=&quot;/Presentations/rladies-nyc/data-education.html&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Excited for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/astroeringrand?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@astroeringrand&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RLadiesNYC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@RLadiesNYC&lt;/a&gt; talk on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt; in education! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/wX3PT7F2KI&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/wX3PT7F2KI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Emily Robinson (@robinson_es) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/robinson_es/status/940730589077999617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 12, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look how cool I am. Go me! The slides are &lt;a href=&quot;/Presentations/rladies-nyc/data-education.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in case you missed them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;uncommon-schools&quot;&gt;Uncommon Schools&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been an Associate Director of Data Analytics at Uncommon Schools for almost a year and a half now. Part of my job at Uncommon has been working with and teaching R to my fellow data analysts.  As such, I’ve developed a sense of what works best for the type of messy data we’re constantly analyzing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bit of background, Uncommon Schools is a Charter Management Organization (CMO), or network of 52 public &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uncommonschools.org/our-approach/faq-what-is-charter-school&quot;&gt;charter schools&lt;/a&gt; across Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. The oldest school (North Star Academy in Newark) was established in 1997 and the CMO was formed in 2005. For a more in depth history of Uncommon Schools, check out our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uncommonschools.org/our-approach/our-history&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.uncommonschools.org/sites/default/files/datagraphics_063017.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;uncommon-schools&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-kind-of-data-do-we-work-with&quot;&gt;What kind of data do we work with?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data Analytics team focuses at the overall picture, so while we don’t work on reporting data directly back to the state (our regional teams have excellent people working on this) we do get to work with most of the data the organization collects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data we work with generally fits into one of these buckets…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessments&lt;/strong&gt;: Interim assessments are taken as practice tests through out the school year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exams&lt;/strong&gt;: Common Core aligned state exams, SAT, PSAT, APs, …etc&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classroom&lt;/strong&gt;: Assignment grades, attendance, suspensions, …etc&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher&lt;/strong&gt;: student - course - teacher linkage information&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staff Data&lt;/strong&gt;: HR and Recruitment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, given the amount of data we have and the number of sources it may be coming from, we have a ton of data challenges to overcome in every analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, every piece of data has its own challenges and “messy nature,”  but there are patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Missing/Incomplete data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Different data sources without matching IDs (i.e HR to Teacher to Student)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Movement between schools and courses of students and teachers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alignment of data and data processes across all schools and regions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Student IDs that change&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Human data reporting error&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Historical data quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these challenges are easy to fix and some are harder. For example, a messy excel sheet can be cleaned (by hand or by code). We’ve developed (or are developing in some cases) systems to work with most of these types of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Messy excel sheets (historical or human entered)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Column names that don’t apply anymore&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lack of historical documentation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finding duplicate tests&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Students that take half of one test and the other half of another&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vanishing leading zeros&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tracking of student IDs that change&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lack of common definitions (i.e “cohort”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to refer to school years or school abbreviations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data audits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-janitor-package&quot;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;janitor&lt;/code&gt; Package&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like this explanation by package author, Sam Firke. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sfirke/janitor&quot;&gt;Janitor&lt;/a&gt; was built with beginning-to-intermediate R users in mind and is optimized for user-friendliness. Advanced users can already do everything covered here, but they can do it faster with janitor and save their thinking for more fun tasks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaning, if you’re experienced with the Tidyverse in general, you should be able to do everything inside &lt;code&gt;janitor&lt;/code&gt; on your own. However, we don’t always have the time to always clean up data without some help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media3.giphy.com/media/3oKIPCSX4UHmuS41TG/giphy-downsized.gif&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like using &lt;code&gt;janitor&lt;/code&gt; over writing my own code because, (1) functions are well tested, (2) I can turn multiple lines of code into one or two, and (3) the &lt;code&gt;janitor&lt;/code&gt; functions are written to be pipe-able to work in the tidyverse space. It’s a pretty cool bonus that Sam works in the education space, so the functions were created to handle the education data problems I constantly face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-example-using-janitor-to-clean-a-messy-excel-file&quot;&gt;An example, using &lt;code&gt;janitor&lt;/code&gt; to clean a messy excel file.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m often tasked with cleaning roster files, which contain entry and exit data for students. These files can be very messy due to students who moved between schools or were not exited properly from the system, causing duplicates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clean this data, first I read it in with &lt;code&gt;read_excel&lt;/code&gt; and use &lt;code&gt;janitor&apos;s&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;clean_names&lt;/code&gt; to convert all the column names to something I can use. &lt;code&gt;remove_empty_cols&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;remove_empty_rows&lt;/code&gt; remove entire columns or rows that are NA as excel sometimes can’t tell where there is data and where there isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I choose to use &lt;code&gt;col_type = &quot;text&quot;&lt;/code&gt; in my &lt;code&gt;read_excel&lt;/code&gt; statement, because I sometimes have to deal with leading zeros, NAs that are not written as NAs, or other text fields in my numerical columns. Reading in as text and converting later allows me to find and correct problems before they become NAs. I use &lt;code&gt;mutate_at&lt;/code&gt; to convert these columns back to numbers after examining that everything looks good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;students &amp;lt;- readxl::read_excel(filepath, sheet=&quot;Sheet1&quot;, col_types = &quot;text&quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  janitor::clean_names() %&amp;gt;%
  janitor::remove_empty_cols() %&amp;gt;%
  janitor::remove_empty_rows() %&amp;gt;%
  dplyr::mutate_at(vars(entrydate, exitdate, student_id, yearsinuncommon), as.numeric) %&amp;gt;%
  dplyr::mutate_at(vars(entrydate, exitdate), excel_numeric_to_date) 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step in data cleaning is to look for duplicates. Luckily, &lt;code&gt;janitor&lt;/code&gt; has a super helpful &lt;code&gt;get_dupes()&lt;/code&gt; function which does just that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;students %&amp;gt;% 
  get_dupes(student_id)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# A tibble: 2 x 6
  student_id dupe_count grade yearsinuncommon  entrydate   exitdate
       &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;int&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;           &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;date&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;date&amp;gt;
1    2342675          2    10               1 2017-11-11 2017-12-11
2    2342675          2    11               1 2017-11-11 2017-12-11
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example data, I have one student with duplicate information. They’re in two different grades, ugh! Now, I have to choose a method to correct this student in my data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;there-are-three-main-ways-i-use-to-correct-dupes&quot;&gt;There are three main ways I use to correct dupes.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-correct-the-dupes-individually-with-if_else-or-case_when&quot;&gt;1. Correct the dupes individually with &lt;code&gt;if_else&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;case_when&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are only a few duplicates, or they’re all in one grade or class room, a quick set of &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; statements will do the trick to make the rows perfectly duplicated. From there, use &lt;code&gt;distinct&lt;/code&gt; to get only distinct rows and remove the duplicates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;mutate(students, grade = if_else(student_id == 2342675, 10, grade))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-summarize-by-taking-minimum-date--grade-to-choose-one-row-to-keep&quot;&gt;2. Summarize by taking minimum date / grade to choose one row to keep.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is helpful if you just need one of the rows, and don’t really care which row is the one you keep. For example, our exit and enter date information is not usually great, so I’m okay with the ‘just pick one’ version as long as the student’s grade and teacher information is the same in both rows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;group_by(students, student_id) %&amp;gt;% summarize(grade = min(grade))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-output-the-duplicates-and-manually-choose-which-version-to-keep&quot;&gt;3. Output the duplicates and manually choose which version to keep.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This involves the most manual work, so I usually grab help when I need to do this, yay teammates!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;dupes_correct &amp;lt;- read_csv(&quot;dupes_correct.csv&quot;)
left_join(students, dupes_correct) %&amp;gt;%
  replace_na(list(keep = 0)) %&amp;gt;%
  assert(not_na, keep) %&amp;gt;%
  filter(keep = 0)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;managing-data-changes&quot;&gt;Managing Data Changes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As data is updated, there might be more duplicates to worry about. A great way to check for duplicate updates is to use the 1:2 punch of &lt;strong&gt;janitor’s&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;get_dupes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;assertr’s&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;verify()&lt;/code&gt;. This allows you to put checks in place in case the data changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;check &amp;lt;- students %&amp;gt;% 
  get_dupes(student_id) %&amp;gt;% 
  verify(nrow(.) == 0)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If new duplicates occur the code will HALT at this step alerting that something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;an-example-project-state-test-analysis&quot;&gt;An Example Project: State Test Analysis&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest impact project the data analytics team is in charge of all year is our annual state test analysis. We gather and all the raw results data for each of our schools, clean it, and combine the information into one cohesive story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old process for this used a lot of excel workbooks, manual edits, and a very confusing naming system to port the data into tableau dashboards. With the many steps, and points of error, the process took a really long time. A big goal of ours was to go from raw data to published tableau dashboard in a &lt;em&gt;few hours&lt;/em&gt; without any big hiccups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year we completed an overhaul of the process with R scripts, that clean and QC the data, add variables we need for analysis, combine with historical state test results, and output tableau ready inputs. The entire state test analyses from raw data to dashboard can now be completed with the press of a few buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Presentations/rladies-nyc/process.png&quot; height=&quot;100px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;PURRR&lt;/code&gt; code to read and combined multiple files into one data frame has been the saving grace of this analysis. We have each grade/subject/school combination in a separate file, and with just a few lines of code R can bring them together for further cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;files &amp;lt;- list.files(&quot;../Input/&quot;, pattern = &quot;.xlsx&quot;, full.names =  TRUE)
nys &amp;lt;- map_dfr(files, prep_nys_files)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious to other parts of the code that really changed this process (for example &lt;code&gt;assertr&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;tidyr&lt;/code&gt;) please feel free to ask!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;wrap-up&quot;&gt;Wrap Up&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes didn’t come easy for my team. I work with a group of extremely smart people, but before I started with Uncommon most people on my team didn’t code at all let alone use R. It’s been part of my job to teach everyone to write in R, and make sure we’re all using best practices. One day I will write a longer blog post about some of the learnings I’ve had throughout this process, so stay tuned for that! In the mean time, I offer you some closing remarks on what I’ve found to work best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choose the packages to teach that are needed every day. (For me, this was &lt;code&gt;janitor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have someone that is active in R community, so that you can be on the cutting edge of best practices and new packages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The more practice someone has, the faster they’ll learn. Pair professional development sessions with coding projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing my team to the &lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;janitor&lt;/code&gt; have been a really big help for getting my team members on board and excited about learning and using R. A quick demonstration of &lt;code&gt;group_by()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get_dupes()&lt;/code&gt; was really all I needed to motivate big changes in our analysis process.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Update to Lizzie Bennet Text Analysis Using Plotly</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/d4tagirl&quot;&gt;Daniela Vázquez&lt;/a&gt; recently published her &lt;a href=&quot;https://d4tagirl.com/2017/05/how-do-you-feel-about-last-week-tonight&quot;&gt;blog post on Last Week Tonight&lt;/a&gt;. She used a bunch of code from my previous LBD analysis (THANKS FOR THE LOVE DANIELA! :heart:) and also created this super cool &lt;code&gt;plotly&lt;/code&gt; widget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had never used &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;plotly&lt;/code&gt; before and wanted to give it a try, recreating a previous plot of sentiment by LBD episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;library(viridis)
library(plotly)

p &amp;lt;- ggplot(lbsentiment, aes(x=index, sentiment, fill=as.factor(index), text=title)) +
    geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, show.legend = FALSE) +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
    geom_text(aes(x=index, y=plot_sentiment, label=plot_index), size=3.5) + 
    labs(title = &quot;Sentiment in Lizzie Bennet Diaries&quot;,
         y = &quot;Sentiment&quot;
         ) +
    scale_fill_viridis(end = 0.75, discrete=TRUE, direction = -1) +
    scale_x_discrete(expand=c(0.02,0)) +
    theme(strip.text=element_text(hjust=0)) +
    theme(strip.text=element_text(face = &quot;italic&quot;)) +
    theme(axis.title.x=element_blank()) +
    theme(axis.ticks.x=element_blank()) +
    theme(axis.text.x=element_blank()) +
    theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;)

ggplotly(p, tooltip=&quot;text&quot;, width=750, height=400)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>Text Analysis of The Lizzie Bennet Diaries</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://juliasilge.com/&quot;&gt;Julia’s Silge’s&lt;/a&gt; recent talk on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://tidytextmining.com/&quot;&gt;Tidytext&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/&quot;&gt;NASA
Datanauts&lt;/a&gt;, and her blog
posts, I decided to try my hand at some text analysis. Julia’s examples
focus on the works of Jane Austen. As Jane Austen has been adapted so
many time, I decided to “adapt” Julia’s talk for the modern works of
Austen’s book Pride and Prejudice - specifically the Lizzie Bennet Diaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.pemberleydigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/LBD-FacebookCover-Emmy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pemberleydigital.com/the-lizzie-bennet-diaries/&quot;&gt;Image source: Pemberly Digital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-lizzie-bennet-diaries&quot;&gt;The Lizzie Bennet Diaries&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pemberleydigital.com/the-lizzie-bennet-diaries/&quot;&gt;Lizzie Bennet
Diaries&lt;/a&gt; is
a modern adaptation of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice for YouTube.
The story is told through a series of Vlogs by Lizzie Bennet as part of
a school project. The series, created by Hank Green and Bernie Su, first
aired on April 9, 2012, making this year the &lt;strong&gt;5th Anniversary&lt;/strong&gt; of the
series! Altogether, the series filmed more than 100 video episodes with
over 9.5 hours of video making it the longest adaption of Pride and
Prejudice to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the main LBD channel, there are also some supporting
channels. These allow other characters to tell parts of the story that
Lizzie doesn’t take part in. For example, Lydia’s Vlogs include the
story on how she meets George Wickham and their budding relationship.
While not required viewing, these extra videos help round out the
experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the series ended, 2 books have come out from the creators and
writers of the original videos: one that follows the videos but adds
some more detail to Lizzie’s life, and one that focuses on Lydia’s story
after the series ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In honor of LBD’s 5th Anniversary, let’s do some LBD text analysis!
&lt;strong&gt;Happy Anniversary LBD!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media3.giphy.com/media/10MjSRjJxjc6XK/giphy-downsized.gif&quot; alt=&quot;celebration+lizzie+bennet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;analysis&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gathering-data&quot;&gt;Gathering Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of this analysis is grabbing all the text from YouTube.
To access the API, I use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://soodoku.github.io/tuber/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tuber&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
package by Gaurav Sood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;
library(tidyverse)
library(tuber)

yt_oauth(app_id, app_password)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fist step was to find the channel id to access the LBD playlist. I
do a quick search for &lt;code&gt;lizziebennet&lt;/code&gt; to find some videos that I know are
part of the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;
search &amp;lt;- yt_search(&quot;lizziebennet&quot;)[1:5, ] 
search %&amp;gt;% select(title, channelId)

##                                                       title
## 1                         My Name is Lizzie Bennet  - Ep: 1
## 2 The Lizzie Bennet Diaries - Episódio 98 (LEGENDADO PT-BR)
## 3                                      Yeah I Know - Ep: 61
## 4                                 Introducing Lizzie Bennet
## 5                                  The Lizzie Trap - Ep: 78
##                  channelId
## 1 UCXfbQAimgtbk4RAUHtIAUww
## 2 UCfhdE-vIhW9GD0eGdd300ag
## 3 UCXfbQAimgtbk4RAUHtIAUww
## 4 UCGaVdbSav8xWuFWTadK6loA
## 5 UCXfbQAimgtbk4RAUHtIAUww

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the channel ID in hand, I can now access the channel’s resources to
find the playlist ID, which I will use to access all the videos in that
playlist. &lt;code&gt;list_channel_resources&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;tuber&lt;/code&gt; creates a list of channel
attributes and buried in that list in the playlist ID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;
# Channel Information
a &amp;lt;- list_channel_resources(filter = c(channel_id=&quot;UCXfbQAimgtbk4RAUHtIAUww&quot;), part=&quot;contentDetails&quot;)

# Uploaded playlists:
playlist_id &amp;lt;- a$items[[1]]$contentDetails$relatedPlaylists$uploads

playlist_id

## [1] &quot;UUXfbQAimgtbk4RAUHtIAUww&quot;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The YouTube API automatically pages videos so the max you get per page is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I know I need more than that, so I created a function that I call a few times to get all the videos. (This way works, but I would love any comments on how to make it better.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;
# pass NA as next page to get first page
nextPageToken &amp;lt;- NA
vid_info &amp;lt;-{}

# Loop over every available page
repeat {
  vids &amp;lt;- get_playlist_items(filter= c(playlist_id=playlist_id), page_token = nextPageToken)
  vid_ids &amp;lt;- map(vids$items, &quot;contentDetails&quot;) %&amp;gt;%
      map(&quot;videoId&quot;)  %&amp;gt;%
      unlist()
    
  vid_info &amp;lt;- vid_info %&amp;gt;% bind_rows(tibble(ids = vid_ids))
    
  # get the token for the next page
  nextPageToken &amp;lt;- ifelse(!is.null(vids$nextPageToken), vids$nextPageToken, NA)
    
  # if no more pages then done
  if(is.na(nextPageToken)){
     break
  }

}

# check that I have all 112 videos
nrow(vid_info)

## [1] 112

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have a list of video IDs, I can use &lt;code&gt;get_captions&lt;/code&gt; to access
the text of the videos. I also use &lt;code&gt;xmlTreeParse&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xmlToList&lt;/code&gt; to
covert the caption into into an easily accessible lines of text. I put
the text, video ID, and video title in a tibble for use in tidydata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;
library(XML)

getText &amp;lt;- function(id){
  x &amp;lt;- get_captions(id, lang = &quot;en&quot;)
  title &amp;lt;- get_video_details(id)$title
  a &amp;lt;- xmlTreeParse(x)
  text &amp;lt;- a$doc$children$transcript
  text &amp;lt;- xmlToList(text, simplify = TRUE, addAttributes = FALSE) %&amp;gt;% 
    tibble() %&amp;gt;%
    mutate(id = id, title = title)
  return(text) 
}

text &amp;lt;- map_df(vid_ids, getText) %&amp;gt;% 
  set_names(c(&quot;text&quot;, &quot;vid_id&quot;, &quot;title&quot;))

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t actually want to refer to each video by it’s full title, so I do
some data munching to get each episode’s number (1-100). Notice, the
Q&amp;amp;A videos do not get a episode number assigned to them. For the sake of
this analysis, I’ve decided to only work with the main 100 episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;
titles &amp;lt;- text %&amp;gt;%
  distinct(title) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(title = ifelse(title == &quot;Question and Answers #3 (ft. Caroline Lee)&quot;, &quot;Questions and Answers #3 (ft. Caroline Lee)&quot;, title),
         ep_num = gsub(&quot;[- .)(+!&apos;,/]|[a-zA-Z]*:?&quot;,&quot;&quot;, title),
         ep_num = ifelse(title == &quot;2 + 1 - Ep: 73&quot;, 73, ep_num),
         ep_num = ifelse(title == &quot;25 Douchebags and a Gentleman - Ep:18&quot;, 18, ep_num),
         ep_num = ifelse(title == &quot;Bing Lee and His 500 Teenage Prostitutes - Ep: 4&quot;, 4, ep_num),
         ep_num = parse_number(ep.num)
         ) %&amp;gt;%
  filter(!grepl(&quot;Questions and Answers&quot;, title)) %&amp;gt;%
  arrange(ep_num) 

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with using captions, is the messy text. I used a
simple set of &lt;code&gt;gsub&lt;/code&gt; commands to transform obvious punctuation marks into their
English counterparts. I also pulled out the character SPEAKING the words
from the text itself. I left this column alone in the data set, but might
one day go back and focus an analysis on speaking characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;
library(tidytext)
library(stringr)

lizziebennet &amp;lt;- text %&amp;gt;%
  left_join(titles, by=&quot;title&quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  filter(!is.na(ep_num)) %&amp;gt;%
  arrange(ep_num) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(linenumber = row_number()) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(text = gsub(&quot;&amp;amp;#39;&quot;, &quot;&apos;&quot;, text),
         text = gsub(&quot;&amp;amp;quot;&quot;, &apos;\&quot;&apos;, text),
         text = gsub(&quot;&amp;amp;amp;&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, text),
         character = str_extract(text, &quot;^[a-zA-Z]*:&quot;),
         text = sub(&quot;^[a-zA-Z]*:&quot;, &quot;&quot;, text)
         ) %&amp;gt;%
  arrange(ep_num, linenumber)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so now the text is &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; in place. The first thing I did was
look at word counts. The most common words are not surprising, it’s just
a list of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;
lizziebennet %&amp;gt;%
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(word, text) %&amp;gt;%
  anti_join(stop_words, by=&quot;word&quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  count(word, sort=TRUE) %&amp;gt;%
  top_n(10)

## # A tibble: 10 × 2
##         word     n
##        &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;
## 1     lizzie   460
## 2       jane   301
## 3      darcy   243
## 4       bing   232
## 5    collins   220
## 6      lydia   196
## 7     bennet   194
## 8  charlotte   180
## 9       yeah   178
## 10      time   176

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the most common trigrams are from the phrase that begins every episode, “My name is Lizzie Bennet and…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;
lizziebennet %&amp;gt;%
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(word, text, token=&quot;ngrams&quot;, n=3) %&amp;gt;%
  count(word, sort=TRUE) %&amp;gt;%
  top_n(10)

## # A tibble: 10 × 2
##                 word     n
##                &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;
## 1         my name is   106
## 2   is lizzie bennet    96
## 3     name is lizzie    96
## 4  lizzie bennet and    84
## 5       i don&apos;t know    40
## 6          oh my god    36
## 7           a lot of    33
## 8        going to be    31
## 9       what are you    29
## 10     mr collins oh    28

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also especially amused by &lt;em&gt;So good to see you!&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;THE MOST AWKWARD DANCE EVER&lt;/em&gt; being in the Top 10 5-grams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 12 × 2
##                           word     n
##                          &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;
## 1     my name is lizzie bennet    95
## 2    name is lizzie bennet and    83
## 3       is lizzie bennet and i    19
## 4    is lizzie bennet and this    14
## 5    lizzie bennet and this is    11
## 6           so good to see you     9
## 7       had nothing to do with     5
## 8     is lizzie bennet and i&apos;m     5
## 9       lizzie bennet and i am     5
## 10 the most awkward dance ever     5
## 11     what are you doing here     5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sentiment-analysis&quot;&gt;Sentiment Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve chosen to use the Bing lexicon (because of Bing Lee, get it?). In
Tidydata, sentiment analysis is easy because you just join the lexicon
against your tokenzied words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;
bing &amp;lt;- sentiments %&amp;gt;%
        filter(lexicon == &quot;bing&quot;) %&amp;gt;%
        select(-score)

lbwordcount &amp;lt;- lizziebennet %&amp;gt;%
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(word, text) %&amp;gt;%
  anti_join(stop_words) %&amp;gt;%
  count(title)
  
lbsentiment &amp;lt;- lizziebennet %&amp;gt;%
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(word, text) %&amp;gt;%
  anti_join(stop_words) %&amp;gt;%
  inner_join(bing) %&amp;gt;% 
  count(title, index=ep_num, sentiment) %&amp;gt;% 
  spread(sentiment, n, fill = 0) %&amp;gt;% 
  left_join(lbwordcount) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative,
         sentiment = sentiment / n)  

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most positive sentiment episodes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 5 × 2
##                                       title  sentiment
##                                       &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
## 1                    Care Packages - Ep: 58 0.09623431
## 2                         The End - Ep: 100 0.09375000

## 5      Wishing Something Universal - Ep: 76 0.08018868
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most negative sentiment episodes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 5 × 2
##                            title   sentiment
##                            &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;       &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;

## 5      Meeting Bing Lee - Ep: 28 -0.07614213
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was to visualize this in a way where you can look at the sentiment over the episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;
library(viridis)
theme_set(theme_bw()) # a theme with a white background

ggplot(lbsentiment, aes(x=index, sentiment, fill=as.factor(index))) +
        geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, show.legend = FALSE) +
        theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
        geom_text(data=plot_text, aes(x=index, y=sentiment, label=index), size=3.5) + 
        labs(title = &quot;Sentiment in Lizzie Bennet Diaries&quot;,
             y = &quot;Sentiment&quot;) +
        scale_fill_viridis(end = 0.75, discrete=TRUE, direction = -1) +
        scale_x_discrete(expand=c(0.02,0)) +
        theme(strip.text=element_text(hjust=0)) +
        theme(strip.text=element_text(face = &quot;italic&quot;)) +
        theme(axis.title.x=element_blank()) +
        theme(axis.ticks.x=element_blank()) +
        theme(axis.text.x=element_blank())

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lizziebennet_textmining_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Sentiment by main episode of LBD.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia’s sentiment analysis of the original text is much more positive
than my LBD analysis, with two negative portions relating to Darcy
proposing to Elizabeth and Lydia running away with Wickham. I had
expected a similar “Wickham” negative spike in this plot, and while the section of
Wickham related episodes (Ep 84 to Ep 89) is surely negative it’s not
more negative than some of the introductory episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could argue, that since most of the Lydia - Wickham story line happens off screen and in
Lydia’s blogs, that would explain that lack of a clear negative spike in the Wickham episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-sentiment&quot;&gt;More sentiment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing the analysis, I wanted to look at which words were causing
the largest effect on the overall sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;
bing_word_counts %&amp;gt;%
  group_by(sentiment) %&amp;gt;%
  top_n(10) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(word, n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = &quot;free_y&quot;) +
  labs(y = &quot;Contribution to sentiment&quot;,
       x = NULL) +
  coord_flip()

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lizziebennet_textmining_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that this is a modern adaption, it’s interesting that much like
the analysis done on the original “miss” is the top contribution to
negative sentiment. In the original text I would assume a higher count
of “Miss Bennet’s” to the modernized version. However, Lizzie does talk
about you she’ll miss Charlotte, or she misses her home… etc, so it’s
not too surprising to see it have a considerable contribution here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a bit of an investigation into this with bigrams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;
lizziebennet %&amp;gt;%
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(bigram, text, token=&quot;ngrams&quot;, n=2) %&amp;gt;%
  separate(bigram, c(&quot;word1&quot;, &quot;word2&quot;), sep = &quot; &quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  filter(word1 == &quot;miss&quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(miss_in_name = ifelse(word2 %in% c(&quot;bennet&quot;, &quot;lu&quot;), &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;)) %&amp;gt;%
  count(miss_in_name)

## # A tibble: 2 × 2
##   miss_in_name     n
##          &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;
## 1           No    26
## 2          Yes    27

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And oddly enough, the use of the word “miss” is about half and half
between “I miss [person/thing]” and “Miss Bennet” type phrases. Interesting! (Anyone want to guess who refers to Lizzie as Miss Bennet the most? Unsurprisingly, it’s Ricky Collins.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-with-bigrams&quot;&gt;More with Bigrams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;
bigrams_separated &amp;lt;- lizziebennet %&amp;gt;%
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(bigram, text, token=&quot;ngrams&quot;, n=2) %&amp;gt;%
  separate(bigram, c(&quot;word1&quot;, &quot;word2&quot;), sep = &quot; &quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word, 
         !word2 %in% stop_words$word) %&amp;gt;%
  count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE)

bigrams_separated %&amp;gt;% 
  ungroup() %&amp;gt;%
  top_n(10) 

## # A tibble: 11 × 3
##      word1   word2     n
##      &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;
## 1   lizzie  bennet   132
## 2     bing     lee    43
## 3   george wickham    24
## 4      hey  lizzie    24
## 5       de  bourgh    22
## 6    ricky collins    21
## 7      los angeles    20
## 8     miss  bennet    19
## 9     tour  leader    18
## 10   video    blog    17
## 11 william   darcy    17

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the common bigrams are first and last names of
characters, but there’s also some fun other popular bigrams with “tour
leader” and “video blog.” I guess &lt;em&gt;vlog&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t super popular to use on
it’s own yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;network-of-words&quot;&gt;Network of Words&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite part of tidytext is the example on making a bigram
network. It’s just so fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;
library(igraph)
library(ggraph)

set.seed(42)

bigrams_separated %&amp;gt;%
  filter(n &amp;gt; 5) %&amp;gt;%
  graph_from_data_frame() %&amp;gt;%
  ggraph(layout = &quot;fr&quot;) +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), vjust = 1, hjust = 1) +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.ticks.x=element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.title.y=element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.ticks.y=element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.text.y=element_blank())

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lizziebennet_textmining_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I especially enjoy the Bennet sister cluster in the left corner.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New York Rstats Conference</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend was the 2017 RStatsNYC conference. I had a great time talking to friends and meeting new friends throughout the weekend. The speakers covered a variety of topics from data ethics to cloud cloud computing. I’ve complied my notes, plus some of popular tweets from the conference below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-r-helps-airbnb-make-the-most-of-its-data&quot;&gt;How R Helps Airbnb Make the Most of Its Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ricardo Bion, Airbnb&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AirBnD started in 2008 with 1 city and 1 room, now there are 3M homes in 71K cities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;100+ data scietists using a mix of lanaguages mostly R, but lots of python&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why to use an R Packages:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Passing around functions required duplication of work, where as a package can include data, test, add-ins, vignettes, R markdown and notebook templates&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The AirBnB packages have consistent API, branded visualization, branded templates, and of course function functions&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Education:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;made a difference in confidence of R stats&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;new hire buddy&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;intro classes at datacamp if interested, sponsored by airbnb&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;peer support with office hours, code review, R slack group&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;learning lunch, journal club, offsites&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reproducibility:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;scale knowedlge&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;knowledge repo&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;posts have tags with topics, date, then served as a web ui&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;uses github for peer review&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;branded template&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;incorprate best practices from academia and software&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Really intersting talk on using Stochastic Neighbor algorithm with crowd sourcing to get a visual similarity of images.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Motivation of humans and computers working together&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;His talk focused on detecting what type of bird was in an image&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Detecting that there is a bird in the picture is getting easy for computer, but detecting the exact name of the bird is much more difficult&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Working with R in the cloud is different from working with Rstudio on your computer, you have to install all your favroite packages again every time you start up a new server&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bigger instances sizes, analysis while sleeping, running multiple R servers at the same time, instances themselves are disaposable and renewable resources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;able to use tools in a more powerful manor&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;r-makes-the-world-go-round-data-driven-decision-making-at-jetblue&quot;&gt;R Makes the World Go ‘Round: Data-Driven Decision Making at JetBlue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catherine Zhou, JetBlue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting take always throughout the conference was that you can start coding in R pretty quickly, if you start with the right ideas and tools about what R is. Most intro stats classes (mine included) treat R and other programming languages as a calculator. But R is so much more than that! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/catherinezh&quot;&gt;Catherine Z&lt;/a&gt; made a point about giving people templates with tidyverse functions to produce their own analyses. In my own work, I’m helping my coworker think of tidyverse in a similar way to computing excel tasks, i.e &lt;code&gt;group_by()&lt;/code&gt;  %&amp;gt;% &lt;code&gt;summarise()&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to a &lt;em&gt;pivot table&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;mutate()&lt;/code&gt; adds a new column the same you way you might by drag-and-dropping an excel equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also several good comments on how you can learn slowly by doing something small in R (such as doing a bit of cleaning) and then porting it back out to excel or tableau to finish your analysis. Best takeaway? &lt;strong&gt;Not everyone needs to be fluent in R. - &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/catherinezh&quot;&gt;Catherine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gelman, Columbia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reiterating Andrew Gelman’s point about how p-value statistical testing is actually a pretty bad framework for hypothesis testing most of the time. time to really brush up on Bayesian stats. I also liked the general point that you should have to state what you expect to find (alternate hypotheses, estimated effect sizes, whatever) before you go barging around looking for anything and act like whatever you end up with is what you were searching for all along.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Analysis doesn’t end at result delivery - it ends at developing and proselytizing new business strategies and innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automating Excel workflows can be a first step towards bringing R to a team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agile development tells user stories as an empathy hack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;As a ______
I want ______
So I can ______ 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Person-level stories (the near) are always more meaningful than data stories (the far). We need to balance both as Data Scientists.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In development, we need to have an actual user in mind, rather than a theoretical user who wants everything.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Best ways to contribute to open source are to start with improving documentation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open source contributions: failing test with fix &amp;gt; failing test &amp;gt; bug report&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember to include sessionInfo()&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When releasing a package, release quickly, but also slowly - take time to fix dumb decisions
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Bring something new to the community, but don’t reinvent the wheel&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tell people about your package (social media), then listen to how they’re using it&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When thinking about a package: documentation &amp;gt; usability &amp;gt; performance &amp;gt; features&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>My Internship With Crisis Text Line</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of spring semester, I sent in my application to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dosomething.org/&quot;&gt;DoSomething.org&lt;/a&gt; for their Data Intern position. I found out about the position through a communication that started over Github, and thought it sounded interesting. I sent in my resume and cover letter and waited to see what would happen. I made it through to the next rounds. The last step was a phone interview where I gave a quick presentation on my analysis on some data, and talked about what the internship was about and what I was interested in. I mentioned that what brought me to Data Science was teaching, and how I hoped to be involved with research and education technology in the future. I didn’t get the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I got an email directing me to a Data Intern position available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://crisistextline.org&quot;&gt;Crisis Text Line&lt;/a&gt;, where I could work on data related to training crisis counselors. After an interview with Bob Filbin, Chief Data Scientist at CTL, I accepted the internship, and it was the most amazing job I’ve ever had (and I still work for NASA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crisis Text Line was born out of DoSomething.org, and the two companies share an office space. Crisis Text Line does two things: (1) provides free, 24/7 emotional support to people in crisis, by text. And, (2) uses the data to improve the service and the crisis space as a whole. As the Data Intern, I worked in providing data and metrics for products to make the service better. More specifically, I focused in two areas (1) getting more people through the volunteer application and (2) increasing the lifetime number of conversations our counselors take. I used hard numbers and ethnographic research such as interviews and observations to determine user needs and then suggested solutions to solve them. Over the 10 weeks, I successfully researched the major pain points in our application, determined the best way to remove them, wrote a new application, and launched it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience I have gained from this internship has been invaluable to my career and to my person. I’ve gotten to work with the most wonderful people, and spent every day feeling I was doing meaningful work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the many wonderful experiences I was given through this internship, I also made amazing friends with the DoSomething.org and Crisis Text Line interns. The interns at both DS and CTL shared the same set of middle tables, ate together, had meetings together… etc. Getting to know these folks was my absolute favorite part of the internship, and I miss them dearly.  To quote &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.thekelvinliu.com/post/126196358593/internship-complete&quot;&gt;Kelvin&lt;/a&gt; (the data intern at DS) “I don’t think I’ve ever met people so interesting, relatable, and devoted to social change. As great as the professional growth provided by this internship was, these people were really the highlight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the summer having ended, we’ve moved back to school, or other internships. Some have remained in the city (and we still hang out), but others I’ll only see over the internet. That doesn’t change the fact that these people are amazing, and I can’t wait to spend time with them again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were rough spots at the beginning of the internship as I was trying to get a hold of the flow of a tech based not-for-profit start-up, but I got there quick enough. At a regular internship, interns are given jobs that managers may not want to do because they are time consuming or boring. At Crisis Text Line, interns were treated (and acted) like staff. We were given important projects with lasting effects for the company. I used the chance to dive deep into my projects, working hard to get them done correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dived so deep into my work, that I couldn’t be pulled out. Luckily, I don’t have to stop! As of a couple weeks ago, I began my official job with Crisis Text Line as a part-time Data Scientist while I finish my last year of graduate school at Columbia. I feel so lucky to have been given this opportunity to continue working with these amazing people!&lt;/p&gt;
