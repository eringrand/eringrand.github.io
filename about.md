## <a name="experience"></a>

### Uncommon Schools (Data Scientist)
* Produced high-quality analytics work around student and staff data, including prediction models around student state exams, student enrollment, and staff recruitment.
* Lead 6+ group trainings on the R programming language for 10+ coworkers
Automated manual state exam reporting process saving 6+ hours of processing time

### Crisis Text Line (Data Scientist)
* Working at Crisis Text Line as a Data Scientist. You can read about my transition to Data Science at Crisis Text Line [here](http://datascience.columbia.edu/q-erin-grand-data-scientist-crisis-text-line).
* Built and shipped a new volunteer application which has been used by 7600 applicants. Increased the completion rate from 40% to 90%.
* My work has focused on identifying drop off points for trainers and supervisors. I produced cohort reports of training metrics and identified key differences among cohorts to provide trainers with new solutions. I identified counselor churn as the largest organizational priority, and setup tracking, reporting, and analysis of key metrics.
