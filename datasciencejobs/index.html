    <p>I&#39;ve been a data scientist in the non-profit sector for 5+ years. In an earlier conversation with people starting their transition into data science, we talked about how non-profit data can be an excellent place to start. There are some cons to beginning at a non-profit - but I love it.</p>

<p>In my experience, non-profits data roles have similarities with start-up positions. A non-profit data role may involve doing more work than described in the job description (e.g., analysis and project management at the same time). Due to a lack of funding, non-profits cannot hire individual people for all the needed work, so a new hire can end up filling many job roles at once. This early experience in more extensive work is a magnificent step for learning on the job. &quot;Personally, I think non-profit DS is the perfect place to start a career :) so much messy data, and so many wins, even from &quot;basic&quot; models.&quot; (Caitlin Hudon) In larger for profit-tech companies, In for-profit tech companies, people are not wearing some many hats. In non-profits, you end up being more cross trained. </p>

<p>On the other hand, a possible con to joining a smaller non-profit OR start-up is that you may be one of the first data people in the company. Data Science teams often don&#39;t exist at non-profits, and as the first or early data person, you are forced to grow your skills quickly on the job, but it also means you won&#39;t have an on-site mentor on the job. &quot;In my current position, my manager is self-taught in coding... He does most things in SQL.&quot; - Kevin Gilds. In chapter 9 of their book, Building a Career in Data Science, Emily Robison &amp; Jaqueline Nolis talk more about being the first or only data person on the job. When there is a data team in place, non-profits often have smaller data teams. The day-to-day work is likely to be more aligned with reporting/analysis than machine learning. If you are looking specifically to get involved in modeling ASAP, a non-profit will not be the best place to start. That said, the messy data difficulties in a non-profit can often lead to quick wins for automation and coding. </p>

<p>In companies without a dedicated data team, data structures and cleaning become crucial as data is likely in spreadsheets. SQL and Excel skills are more appreciated than complicated programming skills.  I have loved working with messy data as it has allowed me to shape the policies and work to create more organized structures. &quot;You will never find better datasets to cut your teeth on than working with non-profit data.&quot; (Caitlin Hudon)  Given the often early data stages, you can do quick magic with a spreadsheet. Apply some automation in an excel macro or a pivot table gives you an early win with the data and stakeholders. Teaching others how to do a vlookup could make a difference between them spending 5min vs. 1-2 hours on a task.</p>

<p>The clear win or difference, for me, at a non-profit is that everyone is passionately mission-driven. Non-profit employees are not there just for the money (though, hey - let&#39;s pay people what they&#39;re worth, please). Tech and data skills can be uniquely used in a mission-driven space to do fantastic work to make the world better. For example, in an education company, working with student data can directly influence how a teacher can help them perform even better on SATs, enabling them access to a better college. At a mental health company, data work provides information for counselors to better help their clients - literally saving lives. </p>
